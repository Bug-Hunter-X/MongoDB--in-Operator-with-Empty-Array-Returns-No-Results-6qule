# MongoDB $in Operator with Empty Array
This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in MongoDB queries involving the `$in` operator when used with an empty array.  The issue arises when attempting to find documents where a field's value exists within an empty array. This query unexpectedly returns no results, even if the field exists in documents.

The solution provided addresses this issue by handling the case of an empty array to avoid unexpected query behavior.

## How to reproduce the error

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Ensure you have MongoDB running and a suitable collection named `myCollection` with at least one document containing the `field` property. 
3. Run `bug.js` to see the unexpected result.
4. Run `bugSolution.js` to see the correct solution.

## Solution
The solution involves checking whether the array used with `$in` is empty. If it is empty, use an alternative query method that accounts for this case, such as returning all documents if an empty array is given.
